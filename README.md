# AWS Developer Environment with Terraform

This project is a hands-on guide to building a development environment on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** using **Terraform**. It's designed to help you learn the basics of Terraform while creating a functional and fun setup.

## About the Project

This project is part of a learning journey inspired by **Derek Morgan**'s course on Terraform and AWS. You can find the course here:

## Infrastructure Components

- VPC with DNS support
- Public subnet
- Internet Gateway
- Route Table with public route
- Security Group allowing SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic
- Latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI (auto-detected)
- EC2 instance with Docker and Docker Compose
- SSH key pair configuration
- User data script to install and configure the environment

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **AWS Account**: Sign up for a free account at [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. **Terraform Installed**: Download and install Terraform from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/) (version >= 1.0.0).
3. **AWS CLI**: Install the AWS CLI from [AWS CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
4. **SSH Key Pair**: Generate an SSH key pair if you don't have one: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AWS_DevEnv_With_Terraform.git
cd AWS_DevEnv_With_Terraform
```

### Step 2: Authenticate with AWS

Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

### Step 3: Customize Configuration (Optional)

Edit `terraform.tfvars` to customize the deployment according to your preferences.

### Step 4: Initialize and Apply Terraform

Initialize Terraform and create the resources:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Step 5: Connect to Your Instance

After successful deployment, you can connect to your instance using:

```bash
ssh devenv
```
